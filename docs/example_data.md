# Example Data and References

## Raw image dataset

Our compressed raw example image dataset is provided online courtesy of The Open Science Framework, a free online project management repository. It is easily extractable using 7-Zip, an open-source file archiver.

**Extraction directions:**
1) Download the 7-Zip free archiving software.
2) Due to storage limitations, we split data from each channel into two compressed files. The file extensions ending ‘7z.001’ and ‘7z.002’ belong to the same channel. “C01” indicates the segmentation channel files while “C02” indicated autofluoresence channel files.
3) Download both 7-Zip files belonging to the segmentation channel from the repository. Highlight both files in the downloads folder and select ‘extract files’ using 7-Zip. Set the extraction to your preferred folder and click ‘Okay.’
4) Repeat step 3 for the autofluorescence channel.
